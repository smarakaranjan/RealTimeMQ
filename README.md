ðŸ”§ Usage

âœ… Publishing Messages

You can publish messages using the MqttService class:

from mqtt_service.mqtt_client import MqttService

mqtt_service = MqttService()
await mqtt_service.publish(topic="chat/general", message="Hello, MQTT!")

âœ… Subscribing to Topics

All active topics are automatically subscribed when the Django app starts.

To manually subscribe to a topic:

await mqtt_service.subscribe("chat/general")

âœ… Sending Notifications

To send a notification to a specific user or broadcast:

await mqtt_service.notification(message="New update available!", user=user_instance)

âš¡ Running in Production

For production, ensure you have a proper .env setup with an external Mosquitto MQTT broker and use a process manager like Supervisor or Systemd to keep the service running.
